Django project "News Portal" 
In the course of working with the module, you had to complete the following tasks:

1. Create a new page with the address /news/, which should display a list of all news.

2. Display all articles in the form of a title, publication date and the first 20 characters of text.
News should be displayed in order from newest to oldest.

3. Make a separate page for full information about the article /news/<news id>.
This page should contain all the information about the article. Title, text and date of upload in day.month.year format.

4. Write your own censor filter, which replaces the letters of unwanted words in the titles and texts of articles with the symbol "*".

5. All new pages should use the default.html template as a base.
